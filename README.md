# Java-Base_Converter

Simple way to visualize the conversion of numbers to any base from any base (ei: conversion binary-decimal).

This code does not attempt to find the fastest/best solution, but rather the way used using nothing but a piece of paper and a pencil.
If you want a fast converter, please look for other solution.
